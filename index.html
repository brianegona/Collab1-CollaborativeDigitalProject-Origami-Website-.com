        <h2>Discover the Art of Origami</h2>
        <p>The art of origami, or folding paper, has its roots in Japan and became widely known throughout the world in the 1960s. Prior to 1900, paper folding techniques were practiced separately in China, Japan, and Europe. Origami originated in Japan as a gift-wrapping technique.</p>

        <p>Early in the 20th century, modern origami came into being as a result of the innovations made by artists such as Akira Yoshizawa, who turned the craft into sculpture. Following World War II, origami became popular in America and Europe, sparking a variety of movements and genres.</p>

        <p>Origami has numerous benefits, including improving concentration, enhancing creativity, and promoting relaxation. It is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. Have fun learning some of our interesting techniques!</p>
